# Univariate Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
This is an application of Linear Regression using the Gradient Descent algorithm.

This algorithm is currently available for use through packages like sci-kit learn, but I decided to code it from scratch myself, to force myself to understand the underlying math.

Future goals for this project include compatibility with multiple variables, and other versions of Gradient Descent such as Stochastic Gradient Descent or Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.

If you're interested in learning the math for yourself, I followed Andrew Ng's Stanford Machine Learning Course, found here:
