# Linear Regression using Gradient Descent: Interactive Demo
This is an interactive demo of of Linear Regression using the Gradient Descent algorithm.
User is asked to initialize a number of variables and then will be given opportunities to change learning rate & epochs to gain intuition about the effects that parameter tuning has on loss.

This algorithm is currently available for use through packages like sci-kit learn, but I decided to code it from scratch myself, to force myself to understand the underlying math.

Future goals for this project include compatibility with other types of Gradient Descent such as Stochastic Gradient Descent or Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.
